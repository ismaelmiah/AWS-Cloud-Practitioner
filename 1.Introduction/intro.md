## What is Cloud Computing?
- >Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute power; database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.
- You can provision **exactly the right type and size of computing** resources you need.
- You can access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly**.
- Simple way to access **servers, storage, databases** and a set of **application services**.

## Different Types of Cloud Computing


|Private Cloud|Public Cloud|Hybrid Cloud|
|-------|------|--------|
|Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.| Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet |Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud|
|Complete control|Six advantages of Cloud Computing|Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure|
|Security for sensitive applications||Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud|
|Meet specific business needs|||

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- **On-demand self service**
    - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- **Broad network access**
    - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling**
    - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
    - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- **Rapid elasticity and scalability**
    - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
    - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- **Measured service**
    - Usage is measured, users pay corerctly for what they have used


## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**
    - Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
    - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- **Benefit from massive economies of Scale**
    - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- **Stop guessing capacity**
    - Scale based on actual measured usage
- **Increase speed and agility**
- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
- **Go global in minutes**: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## Types of Cloud Computing

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
    - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
    - Provide networking computers, data storage space
    - Highest level of flexibility
    - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
    - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

### On-premises
- Applications
- Data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- OS

## Examples of Cloud Computing Types
- **Infrastrucutre as a Service**
    - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
    - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- **Platform as a Service**
    - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
    - Heroku, Gloogle App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure(Microsoft)
- **Software as a Service**
    - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
    - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

## Basic pricing of the Cloud
> AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go model
- **Compute**: Pay for the compute time
- **Storage**: Pay for data stored in the cloud
- **Data transfer OUT of the cloud**: Data transfer IN is free
